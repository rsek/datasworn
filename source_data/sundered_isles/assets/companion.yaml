              * If you rolled a miss, reroll all dice. If you miss again, the skull leads you astray.

            When you make a move by setting loose the rat to cause a distraction or commotion among a crowd or in a public space, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit with a match, it creates unexpected chaos; take +1 momentum more.

            When you summon the Kraken, fill one segment of a four-segment clock. The Kraken will heed a single command to destroy or overcome any foe or obstacle. If you are in a fight, [Take Decisive Action](move:starforged/combat/take_decisive_action) with an automatic strong hit. When the clock is filled, [Ask the Oracle](move.oracle_rollable:starforged/fate/ask_the_oracle.fifty_fifty) (using the yes/no table) if the Kraken turns against you, making it 50/50. On a yes, discard this asset; the Kraken is now an epic foe. On a no, clear one segment of the clock.
