        summary: A great war left horrible scars upon the isles.
        description: |-
          A generations-old war is only recently ended, and the reminders of that fruitless conflict are all around us. Islands wracked by destruction, seas tainted, people displaced. The cost is immeasurable, but some still squabble over what remains.
        quest_starter: |-

        summary: Eons ago, a vast cataclysm shattered continents.
        description: |-
          Lands broke apart in an apocalyptic disaster. Powerful cities fell. Fire, lava, and ash scoured what remained. The isles, scattered like broken shards, are the vestiges of these once-great lands, the gravestones of a fallen dominion. Life eventually returned to this realm, but the wounds do not fully heal.
        quest_starter: |-
          You are haunted by dreams of this ancient cataclysm. In those dreams, you see a grand library of unfathomable scope, the collected knowledge of lost people and fallen dominions. What do you seek within this repository?

        description: |-
          An ambitious few dabbled in ancient secrets, and in doing so, broke the bonds of reality. Strange energies flowed into our world, allowing uncanny phenomena to take hold. Science and magic took new forms. People and creatures of other realms were cast into our own like jetsam in a turbulent tide. The isles are forever altered by the curse of these chaotic realities.

        description: |-
          Former communities—even entire islands—are sometimes forsaken by their people. Others are lost and forgotten through the ravages of time. These places echo with the memories of lost lives, but also remind us of the perseverance of those who survived to carry on their traditions elsewhere.

        summary: Two centuries ago, a powerful empire dared to claim these isles as their own. Ruined places are all that remain to mark their hubris.
        description: |-
          The tattered banners of the fallen empire lie amid ravaged fortresses, wrecked ships, and abandoned cities. In some places, nature reclaimed these sites. In others, people return to build anew upon the graves of these former invaders. Meanwhile, scavengers—like gulls picking at the bones of dead fish—scour the remnants in search of plunder.

          These people unlocked secrets beyond our understanding. The ruins marking their legacy are places of unnatural construction, confounding mechanisms, and cryptic relics. Some islanders revere the ancients. Others seek to understand them. A few have more selfish motives—pillaging the sites for treasure and artifacts. But some secrets are best left buried. Many ruins are cursed, corrupted by time, and haunted by malignant evil.

          Sailing ships navigate the farthest reaches and weather the fiercest storms. Their cannons unleash devastating barrages against rivals or raiders, and their crews wield muskets and blades to defend their decks.

          The winds of change are upon us. Some of these innovations inspire awe— flying machines that sail among the clouds, metal diving bells that plumb the greatest depths, and mechanical limbs of intricate design to replace what was lost. But industry is also an insatiable fire. Mines, smelters, and factories reshape our lands to feed those flames. Titanic ships seek dominance of the isles. Is it only a matter of time before our steadfast wooden ships and the simple ways of our communities are relics of a bygone age?

          Some have wielded ancient secrets and extraordinary science to power vessels, weapons, and other machines. Their ships are fitted with energized sails that augment the powers of wind and storm. Their cannons unleash volleys of infernal energies. A few commanders even count iron automatons, given life by improbable technologies, among their crew. Resisting these wonders is like casting a stone against a thunderstorm, and many see this new age as a portent of our doom.

        summary: Some see iron vows as a vestige of a more superstitious age, but the tradition persists.
        description: |-
          Our forebears bound their promises to the strength and permanence of iron. Today, self-avowed Ironsworn respect this tradition by affirming their resolve with a time-honored phrase: “By iron, I vow.” Even those who forgo an iron totem say the words to lend solemnity to a promise, setting themselves on an honorbound course—wherever it may lead.
        quest_starter: |-
          The Iron Tide, a force of warships whose commanders and crews have taken up the vow of their fallen leader, is bound for local waters. What do they seek, and why do you swear your own vow to prevent it?

        summary: The Ironsworn bind their honor to iron blades.
        description: |-
          Even in this age of cannon and rifle, a finely-wrought blade—whether sword or dagger, dirk or bayonet—remains a mark of skill and resolve. When the Ironsworn swear a vow upon a blade, we bind our commitment to the metal. If we forsake a vow, that iron must be abandoned. To be Ironsworn without a blade is to be disgraced.

        summary: Since the distant time when iron was first hammered into form, seafaring folk of this world carried iron bondstones as sacred keepsakes.
        description: |-
          Each bondstone is unique—a relic of kin and culture—passed from one generation to the next. They are said to connect the soul of its keeper to their homeland or loved ones as if by an invisible thread. Thus, if lost at sea, our spirit may return home rather than remain entombed in the remorseless depths. We swear our vows upon bondstones as promises that follow us to our death—and beyond. But bondstones can also embody the curses of lost lives and forsaken vows, and bearing that weight can make them feel as heavy as a ship’s anchor.

          A merciless and powerful raider wears the bondstones of their victims as trophies. One of those totems is rightfully yours. To whom did it previously belong?

        description: |-
          The people of the isles are often isolated. Trade and communication must overcome distance and the fickle nature of the surrounding waterways. Known passages are undone by tumultuous weather, capricious seas, or unforeseen conflicts. In spite of those challenges, skilled voyagers and their indomitable vessels are a tether that binds the people and places of remote seas into a greater community.

          The Starmarked have an uncanny sense of wind and tide, and bear the history of their travels as beautiful and intricate tattoos—etched in phosphorescent ink. Some of the places and passages pioneered by the Starmarked are now common knowledge, inscribed in charts and traveled widely. Others are coveted secrets, or lost to time and strife. The skills of the Starmarked make them highly valued as ship navigators, and some seek to exploit them to their own ends.

          Bleakmists are a damnable, seabound fog. Mariners tell of inexplicable sensations within the cursed waters of the mists—whispered voices, the ghostly clanging of ship bells, half-seen phantom shapes. Some bleakmists never dissipate, forming an enduring barrier that only the most foolhardy attempt to navigate. In other places, mists gather with little warning. Once you enter a bleakmist, it’s hard to predict where—or if—you’ll emerge.

          The empires have only a minor presence; their outposts are isolated and pose little threat. But there are resources and riches to be exploited, and freedom is a fragile thing. Even now, imperial agents are said to be among us, working in the shadows, planting the seeds of conquest.
        quest_starter: |-
          A conflict between two nations is raging. Some suggest the war was sparked by imperial agents, working behind the scenes to destabilize the region and open a path for colonization. Can you convince the leaders of these powers to abandon their fighting and focus on the true threat?

        summary: Imperial forces vie for dominion over the Sundered Isles.
        description: |-
          Imperial colonization and exploitation is a creeping tide that threatens to engulf the isles. Colonial governors oversee ever-expanding settlements, while powerful trade companies control key trade routes and resources. Imperial agents conduct missions of subterfuge and assassination. Treaties between the empires are forged and broken on a whim, and mariners can never be certain of what flag will fly over a port from one day to the next.

          Envoys and aristocrats gather for a gala at a governor’s manor house, where a priceless object will be on display as a demonstration of the governor’s power and wealth.

          A time before the empire is a fading memory. Today, their armies and fleets control large swaths of territory in the isles, and their expeditionary forces use coercion and warfare to expand their dominion ever further. Other nations are little more than vassals, their puppet governments loyal to the empire. But there are whispers that the empire has grown complacent.

          Pirates give no quarter to seagoing targets and raze settlements on a whim. Their loyalty is only to crew and captain, but even that bond is fragile. Ritualized duels to decide the captaincy or settle disputes are common, and a long-lived marauder is a rare thing. If you come upon a gray-haired pirate, be wary; they have outwitted sailors better than you a thousand times over.

        description: |-
          A pirate crew is a power unto itself, a diverse band of fugitives, outcasts, and rebels who serve under a ship’s charter and have a say in the operation of the vessel. Pirates do not attack indiscriminately, and give quarter to those who ask for it. They are nevertheless vilified as barbarous murderers by trade guilds, imperial governors, and other powers in the isles. In some ways, this reputation serves them; fear is more powerful than the mightiest cannons or the sharpest swords.

In spite of their uncanny nature, mystics are often hired as aides for powerful leaders, or to help guide ships on perilous voyages. But as the winds and tides are fickle, so is magic, and some fall prey to the dark curse of these forces.
