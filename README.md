## Special Thanks

Thanks to Shawn Tomkin for his excellent solo/co-op GM-less table-top role-playing game, [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/).

Thanks to [XenotropicDev](https://github.com/XenotropicDev) for letting me use the data from [TheOracle](https://github.com/XenotropicDev/TheOracle) (a Discord bot for use with Ironsworn) as a starting point.
